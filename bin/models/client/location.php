/**
 * An application can define locations to whitelist so redirections can be checked 
 * and validated. This prevents the login form from becoming a wildcard redirect 
 * to potentially harmful applications.
 * 
 * If the application defines a return URL that does not match any of the application's
 * paths, we will inform the user about an invalid URL.
 * 
 * Should the application provide no return path, the system will attempt to find
 * a default location to redirect the user to.
 * 
 * @property string $protocol If the protocol is defined, the protocol must match the redirect
 * @property string $hostname If the hostname is provided, the hostname must match
 * @property string $path     If the path is not null, the path must start with the provided string.
 *                            E.g. A path like /user/ will match /user/account too
