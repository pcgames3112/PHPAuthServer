/**
 * While structurally extremely similar to regular access tokens, the refresh token
 * has no ability to provide direct access to a resource, instead it needs to be 
 * traded for an access token.
 * 
 * Since a refresh token must never be used in a context where the regular access
 * token is accepted, and vice-versa, the system is way more stable whenever we 
 * use two separate models, making it easier for the DBMS and providing powerful
 * isolation between the access and refresh tokens.
 * 
 * @property string $type Either access or refresh
 * @property string $token The token identifier
 * 
 * @property UserModel $owner The resource owner
 * @property AuthAppModel $client The application requesting access to the owner's information
 * @property AuthAppModel $server The application containing the application owner's information
 * @property string $scopes A comma separated list of contexts the client wishes to have access to
 * 
 * @property int $created The time the token was created
 * @property int $expires The time the token is no longer valid
 * @property int $ttl The amount of seconds this token was set to be valid
 * 
 * @property SessionModel $session The session that spawned this token
 * 
 * @todo Make an array adapter for contexts so they get automatically separated
